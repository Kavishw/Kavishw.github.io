            <h1>Precharge Circuit</h1>
            <h2> Overview</h2>
            <p1>Precharge circuits are an effective means of preventing stress and damage to electrical systems. 
                They are typically used in electric vehicles, battery management systems, 
                or any loads that have large amounts of capacitance. 
                Capacitive loads require precharge circuits because the uncharged capacitors can produce 
                a short that results in an unlimited inrush of current, which can cause damage to other components 
                of the electrical system. A precharge circuit utilizes a very simple system involving a high wattage 
                resistor and a switch. Its function is to initially limit the current, allowing the capacitors in the device to 
                charge up, and then switch to a short, preventing further damage to the system. The image here illustrates the precharge
                 circuit's operation.  </p1>
            <p1>contactors are shown instead of switches. 
                This is because precharge circuits require both a negative and a positive contactor to 
                ensure safety and greater control. Contactors are used instead of normal relays as they 
                support higher voltages and currents. The contactors are designed using peripheral circuitry,
                 which is the main focus of this board. By using contactors instead of switches, the precharge 
                 circuit can be actuated and controlled more precisely, providing a safer and more effective means
                  of preventing damage to the electrical system.</p1>

            <h2>Schematic Design</h2>
            <h3>Comparator Actuation</h3>
            <p1>Our team drew inspiration from Mr. Salih's design,
                 an experienced electrical lead and manager whose work
                  can be found at: https://www.behance.net/salihm/projects.
                   His design utilized a comparator paired with an RC circuit 
                   to create a timing effect, allowing the contactor to close on
                    the high wattage resistor switch side for a set duration before
                     switching to the positive contactor side. While this design served its
                      purpose for some time, it was not ideal for our team's needs as we required more control over 
                      the specific contactors, including the addition of a negative contactor for safety reasons.  </p1>

            <h3>Transistor Actuation</h3>
            <p1>Our team developed a two-MOSFET actuation system that is
                 controllable via a microcontroller. The system comprises of a logic level 
                 MOSFET for interfacing with the microcontroller and a power MOSFET for directing 
                 a maximum of 100 mA current for the contactor coil control. The circuit design was 
                 simulated and validated using multisim, as shown in the documentation. However, we encountered 
                 issues with circuit isolation since the circuit lacked an adequate buffer for isolating the coil 
                 side of the contactor and the MCU. As a result, we had to explore other approaches to address this
                  limitation. </p1>

            <h3>Transistor - Relay Actuation</h3>
            <p1> Finally, the ultimate configuration employed an n-type power MOSFET as a grounding source while connected to the relay,
                 providing adequate circuit isolation. This design was utilised in the final iteration for the power management board and the precharge circuit. 
                 Furthermore this design was validated by the ASC judge as per the 2024 regulations. 
                 The design is depicted here.</p1>

            <h2>PCB Design</h2>
            <h3>Design Considerations</h3>
            <p1> In order to accommodate for the heat produced from the current on the precharge relay side,
                 which can support up to 90V and a maximum of 25 amps, our team opted to utilize polygon and
                  power planes instead of normal routing. This design decision allowed for an entire plane to
                   distribute power off of, providing better circuit isolation and heat dissipation. Additionally, we 
                   utilized an entire grounding plane for better signal integrity. To prevent accidents, we selected
                    components with a 1.5x higher rating than expected for the board.</p1>
