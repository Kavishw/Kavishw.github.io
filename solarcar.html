            <h1>Solar Car Project</h1>
            <h2>Electrical Team Lead</h2>
            <p2> My passion for engineering has been fueled by my involvement with the McMaster Solar Car team, 
              where I have gained extensive knowledge in electrical engineering concepts such as 
              ower electronics, Printed Circuit Board (PCB) production, battery pack production/design,
               and circuit design. Despite a slow start while adapting to the university environment, 
               I gained significant experience in 2022 and became the electrical lead. 
               Currently, I am focused on completing the power management board and developing an 
               efficient higher-level architecture for the team's battery pack. Our team's success
                can be attributed to our strong work ethic and the contributions of my teammates, 
                including Grigor, Anthony, Aryan, Anand, Lewis, and Eddy, with whom I am incredibly proud 
                to work. As Grigor aptly stated, "Let's grind this board out and finish it!"

                <p>Completed the primary iteration of the Precharge circuit printed circuit board, which is essential in preventing short circuits in the motor controller caused by uncharged capacitors. The decision was made to separate the Precharge circuit from the power management board to minimize the need for replacing the entire board in case of failure. This design choice was made due to the high failure rate of the Precharge circuit and the electromagnetic interference from contactors and relays, which necessitated keeping it as far away as possible from the processing unit.
