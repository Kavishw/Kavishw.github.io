            <h1>Solar Car Project</h1>
            <h2>Electrical Team Lead</h2>
            <p2>Overall, the McMaster Solar Car team has been the key reason of my engineering passion. I have learned about many electrical engineering
                concepts. Specifically with power electronics, Printed Circuit Board production, battery pack production/design, circuit design, and much more. I have also 
                taken into consideration many design constraints and as a result have redesigned the board to be the best possible. 

                Originally this project had started off slowly for me as I was trying to adapt to the university environment, however, in 2022 I had 
                gained quite a bit of experience and became an electrical lead. As of right now I hope to complete the power management board and produce an
                efficient higher level architecture and effective battery pack.

                The key reason for our team successes is the work ethic produced by my team. I could not be more proud of my teammates Grigor, Anthony, Aryan, Anand, Lewis, and Eddy.
                Together we have accomplished a lot and hopefully this continues to happen. 

                As Grigor said it best, "Let's grind this board out and finish it!"

              <h2>Electrical Lead - August 2022</h2>
                <p>Finished producing the primary iteration of the Precharge circuit printed circuit board.
                  Precharge circuit essentially ensures that the capacitors when initially uncharged do not produce a short circuit damaging the internal circuitry of the motor controller. 
                  Precharge was seperated from the power management board to ensure that if the board does fail, 
                  the entire power management board does not need to be replaced. 
                  This was a major design choice because traditionally the precharge and the power management board were one. However, because 
                  this is the board that is the most prone to failure and due to the electromagnetic interference from the contactors and relays 
                  it was decided to keep it further away from the processing unit as much as possible.
