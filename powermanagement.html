            <h1>Power Management</h1>
            <h2> Overview</h2>
            <p1> The power management system (PMS) of the vehicle is designed to be seamlessly 
                integrated with the high-voltage (HV) architecture of the vehicle. 
                The PMS serves the purpose of distributing power to all the low voltage
                 components of the vehicle from two sources, which are the supplementary 
                 12V battery and the main battery's power from the DCDC buck converter. In order
                  to ensure that the designs are up to regulation standards, the PMS is designed 
                  to work in compliance with circuit isolation. The PMS is separated into three 
                  components: BMI, ATI, and AMI, which are responsible for supporting battery main
                   items, auxiliary temporary items, and auxiliary main items respectively. 
                   The propulsionary power supporting components are on the BMI side, while
                    components that switch power supplies are on the ATI side. The AMI side is 
                    reserved for auxiliary components such as the horn or powering switches/contactors. 
                    The power distribution, start-up, shut down, and emergency stop to the entire vehicle 
                    are all controlled by the MCU, PIC18F46K80. </p1>

            <h2>Original Design</h2>
            <p1> When I first joined the team, the design was already in place, and I only made slight modifications. 
                However, the design had several issues such as incorrect component placement, no polygon pours,
                 and incorrect trace thicknesses. Additionally, it did not account for power blips when
                  transferring power sources, start-up and shut down behavior. It was designed using the
                   autoroute rather than manual routing. Due to these issues, Grigor and I had to completely
                    redesign the board and we had to step up to ensure the 
                    board was up to standard.</p1>

            <h2>PCB Design</h2>
            <h3>Design Considerations</h3>
            <p1> To minimize the cost of the board, standard 1-ounce copper fills were utilized rather
                 than 2 fills. A two-layer board was chosen to simplify and minimize the cost of the
                  board. Polygon pours were also utilized to optimize power delivery to each component.
                   Component placement on the PCB was condensed to ensure that it is thermally efficient
                   , and heatsinks were added to important components such as MOSFETS. 
                   Components were also chosen to have around 1.5 times higher thermal and electrical 
                   characteristics than the expected requirements to ensure reliable operation.
                Note that majority of these design considerations were performed from the several high voltage architecture redesigns.</p1>
